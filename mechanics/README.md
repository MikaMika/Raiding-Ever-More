Most raid wings have certain mechanics that are common across more than
one boss. The most common types of mechanics and some strategies to deal
with them are listed here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pushing/Pulling

Pushing or pulling an orb or mob is required for the following:

Push:

- Vale Guardian seekers (can also be pulled)
- Soulless Horror - golem
- Samarog - Rigom
- Escort (for towers)

Pull:

- Gorseval mini ghosts
- Slothasor
- Bandit Trio
- Xera non boss enemies

Pushed by attacking (anyone who has a high attack speed/ranged attacks
can do this. Melee can too but it's harder):

- Keep Construct
- Xera

Note that classes with pull skills can help with these.

The following are techniques for pushing with skills going from most
used to possible but very off meta:

- Druid or Soulbeast takes a longbow and uses 4.
- Druid takes Glyph of Tides.
- Mesmer pulls using focus 4.
- Scrapper pushes using Blast Gyro.
- Berserker pushes using Kick.
- Mechanist uses Force Signet.
- Engineer uses shield.

Less meta:

- Firebrand pushes using hammer.
- Mesmer pushes using greatsword 5.
- Virtuoso pushes using Psychic Force.
- Elementalist pushes using staff air 3.
- Dragonhunter with greatsword 5 twice.
- Dragonhunter with f1 twice.

## Immobilise

In certain fights, we want to keep some of the non boss enemies still.

- Vale Guardian seekers
- Gorseval big ghosts
- Deimos prides
- Soulless Horror flesh golems.
- Dhuum skeletons (if not killed fast)
- Qadim magma elementals (if not pulled)

Your options for this include:

- Druid CA 5.
- Druid staff 4.
- Ranger bringing Entangle.
- Ranger bringing Jacaranda.
- Virtuoso bringing Sword of Decimation.
- Sylvari racial skill Grasping Vines.
- Guardian scepter 3.
- Warrior bringing Throw Bolas.
- Mesmer sword 3 twice.
- Elementalist dagger 3 in earth.
- Tempest using overload earth.
- Tempest using Aftershock.
- Renegade sword.
- Engineer pistol.
- Engineer rifle.
- Ranger shortbow.
- Necromancer dagger 3.
- Thief bringing Devourer Venom.
- Guardian using Signet of Wrath.

There are others but those are the most commonly seen. Usually the druid
will be in charge of immobilise if you have one.
