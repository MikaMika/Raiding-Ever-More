There are certain classes which are better at healing specs than others
and each has its own reasons for being taken. Some are better at certain
boons, some are better at pure healing, some provide mass ressing
ability and some provide damage mitigation.

As an aside, you might hear the terms "main heal" and "off heal".
Honestly, since boons got made 5 person, these terms are obsolete.
They're now all just different flavours of healer.
