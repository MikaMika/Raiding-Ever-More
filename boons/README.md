The boons that need covered are\: might, fury, alacrity, quickness and
protection.

Regeneration and swiftness are also nice to have, and aegis and
stability are used to ignore some mechanics.

Note where the core class is mentioned below, it is a core mechanic that
can be used on any of the elite specialisations too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Might

- +power, +condition damage
- Usually the healer's job.

Druid gives might using the Grace of the Land trait and using their
Celestial Avatar skills. Warhorn 5 will also give 6 stacks of might.

Heal or condition tempest can cover 25 stacks of might.

Heal renegade and herald can provide 20 stacks of might (or 25 with
Lasting Legacy at the cost of alacrity for renegade) for a subgroup.

Heal mechanist can cover 25 stacks of might.

Heal firebrand, scourge and scrapper can do some might for their
subgroups.

Shield chronomancer can do some might.

A herald with Glint will do some might.

Some other classes have skills which give themselves some might.

A staff mirage can provide more than 25 might to the squad using their
ambush skill.

An engineer using Pinpoint Distribution or a warrior using Empower
Allies will provide 5 stacks constantly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fury

- +20% critical chance
- Usually the healer's job.

Druid uses warhorn 5 as their main fury source. They can also take a
trait to give fury on pet swap if they don't have a warhorn, or take
storm spirit.

Heal boon tempest (with air traitline) can cover fury for the squad.

Heal firebrand and heal scrapper can also give fury to their subgroup
(heal scrapper needs Experimental Turrets).

A staff mirage will do some fury from their auto attacks (non ambush).

A mesmer taking the duelling traitline can do 50% fury uptime without
boon duration.

A ranger taking Spotter and revenant taking Assassin's Presence can do
some fury (3s of every 10s).

A herald will pulse fury from its Glint Facets.

Note many EoD specs will do at least some fury for themselves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Alacrity

- +25% skill recharge rate
- Usually provided by a mechanist, mirage, ranger, renegade, tempest or
spectre.

Renegade uses their F4 skill (Orders from Above) to provide alacrity in
a 240 range area.

Mirage's staff ambush provides alacrity.

Chronomancer can provide alacrity for 5 people using Stretched Time,
wells and their shield 5 skill. Chronomancers gain alacrity for
themselves on shatter.

Mechanist provides alacrity by providing barrier and can do this with
their mace auto attack chain.

Rangers can provide alacrity using Nature Magic and spirits.

Tempest provides alacrity at the end of their overload for 5 people.

Spectre provides alacrity using their wells.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quickness

- +50% attack and action speed
- Usually provided by catalysts, chronomancers, firebrands, harbingers,
heralds, scrappers or warriors.

Two people will be appointed to do quickness - one for each subgroup -
as quickness skills are 5 person.

Chronomancer does quickness on shatter in a 360 range with Seize the
Moment. The elite skill Time Warp does 10 person quickness.

Firebrand does quickness using its mantras and the elite skill Feel My
Wrath. Firebrand often does more quickness to itself than others, so
needs to be aware of this.

Scrapper provides quickness using its gyros and by giving superspeed.

Herald can provide quickness with Draconic Echo by using Consume
skills.

Warrior can provide quickness with warhorn and banners.

Do note that some of these are less viable due to being lower damage.

Mechanist, reaper and berserker can do partial self quickness.

Harbinger gives quickness whilst in shroud and Elixir of Anguish.

Catalyst provides quickness with the Spectacular Sphere trait.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Protection

- reduces incoming strike damage by 33%
- Usually provided by the healer.

Druid bring stone spirit to provide protection - however this will only
give about 50% protection uptime.

Heal or condition tempest can cover full uptime of protection.

Alacrigades can give protection using their Kalla utility skills (put
the alacrigade and druid in different subgroups).

Heal scrapper can cover full uptime of protection to their subgroup
using their shield, their heal skill and/or Experimental Turrets.

Heal firebrand can give protection to its subgroup by going into its
tomes, or using mace or shield.

A guardian using Strength in Numbers will give 3s every 10s of
protection (in combat).

A herald will give protection with its Glint facets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Regeneration

- provides healing over time
- Usually provided by the healer.

Staff 5 and Healing Spring provide regeneration. Warhorn skills also
provide regeneration when traited.

Heal tempest will provide constant regeneration using Overload Water,
Soothing Mists (not a boon but a buff that has the same effect), scepter
3, staff 5, warhorn 4, or Flash Freeze. The Invigorating Torrents trait
will cause auras to provide regeneration.

Heal firebrand provides regeneration using mace 2, Tome 2-skill 3 and
Mantra of Lore. If your heal firebrand uses axe, you may need to ask for
regeneration from them if your build depends on it.

Heal scrapper and heal mechanist provide regeneration using Med Kit, and
by cleansing conditions.

Herald also pulses regeneration from its Glint facets and Ventari
skills.

Regeneration scales off healing power. The strongest source of
regeneration will overwrite any others applied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Swiftness

- movement speed increased by 33%
- Usually the job of the healer.

Mostly provided by warhorn 5 from druid.

Heal boon tempest can also cover this for the squad using the air
traitline and auras (or staff 4 can do some).

Heal firebrand does swiftness using their tome 2-skills 3 and 4 or staff
4.

Heal scrapper can provide some using Med Kit and Elixir Gun - however
scrapper provides a huge amount of superspeed (100% increase to movement
speed), which will effectively overwrite swiftness.

Scourge can give swiftness with warhorn or Trail of Anguish.

Herald will pulse swiftness from its Glint facets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Aegis

- blocks next attack
- Usually from a firebrand or chronomancer.

Firebrand (heal or condi or quick), can provide aegis using Tome 3-skill
5, mace and shield as well as Advance.

Chronomancer can give aegis using Well of Precognition, or by using
Signets with the Inspiration traitline (Inspiring Distortion).

Mesmer staff 5 will give some aegis randomly on one of its pulses
(maybe).

Mechanist can provide some aegis on a fairly long cooldown.

Warrior's Banner of Defense will give aegis on initial placement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stability

- protects against control effects
- Usually from a firebrand or renegade.

Guardians can use Stand Your Ground to provide subgroup wide
stability.

Revenants can take Jalis and use skill 3 to provide stability to those
on the road.

Tempest can take a trait to give themselves stability on overload to
prevent being interrupted whilst casting it.

Scourge can take Trail of Anguish to give those who go over the sand
trail stability.

Warrior's Banner of Tactics will give some stability on placement.

Mesmer can take Mantra of Concentration to give subgroup wide
stability.

Mechanist can provide 1 stack of stability on a fairly long cooldown.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Boon thief/daredevil

The stolen skill Detonate Plasma can be used to give all boons except
alacrity to your subgroup. Do note that this is only available at
certain bosses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Boon extension

Some classes have the ability to extend boons on everyone. This means in
experienced groups, you can take lower boon duration. In training
groups, it can help to cover gaps whilst people are learning.

Chronomancer has Signet of Inspiration. This will extend boons for their
subgroup if the inspiration trait is taken.

Tempest has warhorn earth 4. This extends boons for 5 people.

Herald's dragon extends boons for 5 people when it's being upkept. When
the skill is "consumed", it affects 5 people.
