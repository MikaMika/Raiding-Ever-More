There is meta food and then there's non meta food which you can get away
with if you're not speed clearing. If you can afford meta food, go for
that, but some of it is quite expensive. I would note that some builds
do require certain food to perform effectively.

Currently these are:

- Quick firebrand
- Alacrity mirage.

It's also worth knowing which ascended food you need in case you're
running an off meta build. Yes I know, \* gasp \* off meta, but some of
the fun of having learnt a raid is that you can try other things out
than the cookie cutter builds on websites.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Power dps

Your meta food: Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup
(Power/Ferocity).  
Price: about 20-30s each, so fairly expensive.

Your meta utility: Potent Sharpening Stones.  
Cheap utility that does the same stats: Fruitcake (buy loads at
Wintersday for the cheapest price).

Alternative food:  
Plate of Truffle Steak (Power/Precision) - way cheaper but if you're
crit capped, it is wasted stats. About 2-4s each.  
Current Butternut Squash (Precision/Ferocity) - again could be wasted
stats. About 3s each.  
Plate of Spicy Moa Wings (Power/Ferocity) - same stats as the meta food,
but requires Hatched Chilli from Grothmar Valley.  
Avocado Smoothie (Power/Ferocity) - lower levels of the same stats as
the meta food. About 4-5s.  
Plate of Steak and Asparagus (Power/Precision) - lower version of
Truffle Steak but about the same price so just get the steak.

Ascended meta food: Cilantro Lime Sous-Vide Steak OR Peppercorn-Crusted
Sous-Vide Steak (Power/Ferocity).  
Off meta ascended: Plate of Coq Au Vin with Salsa OR Plate of
Peppercorn-Spiced Coq Au Vin (these are power/precision).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Condition dps

Your meta food: Red-Lentil Soabosa OR Rare Veggie Pizza OR Koi Cake
(Expertise/Condi) where you need 6.67% for condition duration. (About
3s - 6s each).  
OR Beef Rendang (Condi/Expertise) where you need 4.67% for condition
duration. (About 20s each).

If you are a condition quickbrand, you need Fire Meat Chilli (about
9-11s). Note it can be cheaper to craft this if you're able to.

If you're an alacrity mirage, you need Orrian Truffle and Meat Stew
(about 8-10s). It can be cheaper to craft this too.

Meta utility: Toxic Focusing Crystal (about 25-30s each).  
Off meta utility: Tuning Icicle - can be higher stats than the crystals
on some classes but usually lower stats (about 8-10s each - get them
during Wintersday).

Alternatives to meta food:  
Super Veggie Pizza (Expertise/Condi) - lower stats than the meta food.
About 2s.  
Bowl of Spicy Meat Chilli (for quickbrands) - lower stats than the meta
so you won't burn cap. About 5-7s.

Ascended meta food: Salsa-Topped Veggie Flatbread OR Peppercorn and
Veggie Flatbread (Expertise/Condition).  
Cilantro and Cured Meat Flatbread OR Peppered Cured Meat Flatbread
(Condi/Expertise).

Note - most condition classes will probably want the Meat Flatbreads.
Elementalists usually want the Veggie Flatbreads.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Boons

Your meta food kinda depends on the class.  
See above for condition quick Firebrand's food. You'll probably want
Toxic Maintenance Oil for utility (about 20s).

For Alacrigade, you can use power dps food as long as your gear reaches
the required boon threshold. You can probably use power utility too.

For Chronomancer, you can either use power dps food or boon food. You'll
probably want boon utility unless your phases are short and can take
power utility.

For Scrapper, you can take power dps food and utility or boon
food/utility.

For alacrity Mirage, your food choice is above. For utility, you will
need Toxic Maintenance Oil (about 20s).

For celestial classes, you probably want Dragon's Revelry Starcake
(about 4-5s) for food and either heal or condition dps utility depending
on what you're focusing on.

Boon food:  
Soul Pastry (Concentration/Power). Usually less than 1s.  
Eggs Benedict (Concentration/Expertise) - for condi quick Chronomancer
or maybe Firebrand. About 14s.

Boon utility:  
Meta (power): Potent Lucent Oil - about 25-30s each.  
Meta (condi): Toxic Maintenance Oil - about 20s each OR Enhanced Lucent
Oil (Chronomancer) - about 17-20s.

Off meta (power): Peppermint Oil - about 1s each.  
Holographic Super Cheese - super expensive, don't buy this!

Ascended food: Plate of Beef Carpaccio with Salsa Garnish OR Plate of
Peppercorn-Spiced Beef Carpaccio (Concentration/Power)  
Salsa Eggs Benedict OR Peppercorn-Spiced Eggs Benedict
(Concentration/Expertise).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Heal food

Meta food: Delicious Rice Balls (Healing/+Outgoing Healing) - about
10-20s each.  
Off meta food: Canned Rice Ball with "Lucky Filling" - lower stats than
the meta - very hard to get a hold of.  
Kralkachocolate Bar (Healing/Toughness) - only use this if you know the
+70 toughness isn't an issue. About 1s - from Dragon Bash.  
Omnomberry Cookie (Healing/Vitality) - about 3s.  
Bowl of Poulty Satay (Healing/Concentration) - about 4-6s.

Meta utility: Bountiful Maintenance Oil - about 30-35s each.  
Off meta: use boon utility if a boon class too
(Druid/Tempest/Renegade/Scrapper/Firebrand) or any utility if a heal
scourge (maybe a Tuning Icicle or Peppermint Oil?).

Do steer clear of the Halloween utilities that give toughness on revive
as you may end up accidentally making someone have higher toughness than
the tank.

Ascended meta food: Bowl of Fruit Salad with Mint Garnish
(Healing/Concentration).  
Other ascended food: Mint Creme Brulee (Concentration/Healing).
