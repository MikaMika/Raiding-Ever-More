Whilst some bosses will require you to bring more condi or more power
dps classes, the standard squad composition is usually the same as it's
based around roles. We'll discuss normal squad composition here -
speedclearing and lowmanning raids will require different strategies.

For a squad, the basic roles will be:

- 1 or 2 healers, to include 1 main heal to provide boons.
- 2 quickness sources.
- 1 or 2 tanks (for some bosses).
- 2 alacrity sources.
- Rest dps players.

Note some classes can cover more than one role, which means you can
bring more dps players. Some classes who cover roles are also basically
dps players.

## Heal

See the [healers] channel for the
various flavours of healer. Currently these are usually:

- Druid
- Firebrand
- Herald
- Mechanist
- Scrapper
- Tempest

Less meta:

- Catalyst
- Renegade

These can give boons to their own subgroup but can't do squad wide boons
on their own. Some do more boons than others and can bring other utility
too. Healers are expected to either do quickness or alacrity in meta
comps.

Note there is a build called Heal Scourge. This is focused on ressing
people and barrier/damage mitigation. It does not really do traditional
healing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quickness sources

See [boons] but your main sources are:

- Catalyst
- Chronomancer
- Firebrand
- Harbinger
- Herald
- Scrapper
- Spellbreaker

These others can, but are less meta:
- Boon thief (where appropriate - see individual guides for where this
works)
- Bladesworn
- Berserker

Every squad will require 2 quickness sources.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Alacrity sources

See [boons] but your main sources are:

- Druid (heal)
- Mechanist (heal, condi, power)
- Mirage (condi)
- Renegade (condi, power)
- Tempest (heal, condi, power)

Others:

- Chronomancer (condi, power)
- Soulbeast (condi, power)
- Untamed (condi, power)

Mechanist is the meta choice for alacrity - it provides alacrity on
barrier generation.

Druid, soulbeast and untamed provide alacrity on spirit use. Tempest
provides pulsing alacrity on overload.

All meta alacrity providers are currently 5 person so one per
subgroup.

Chronomancer can also do 5 person alacrity, however it's the worst
feeling of the alacrity sources currently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tank

This is the person who is going to be smacked by the boss the most
(hopefully). The usual choices are:

- Heal Mechanist
- Heal Firebrand

Mostly the healer will be asked to tank.

Some groups will also get a Druid or Celestial Renegade to tank certain
bosses. Personally I still mesmer tank so Chronomancer, Virtuoso or
Mirage.

Honestly, most classes can tank as long as they have blocks or other
damage mitigation. If you want to try to learn to tank, do these
steps:

- Learn how the fight mechanics work. Usually bosses are toughness,
proximity or special action key based for choosing the tank.
- Watch the boss to learn its attack pattern.
- Work out which skills/traits you have that block or make you
invulnerable.
- Start with high toughness and more blocks than you think you need.
- Lower both as you learn to tank.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dps players

Where most people start. It's always suggested to have a power dps class
and a condi dps class so that you can bring the right ones to the right
bosses - some bosses don't care but some you'll be sad on if you bring
the wrong type.

**Which class should you bring?**

It's an unpopular opinion in some circles, but I tell people to bring
whichever class they're most comfortable on to start with. Flexibility
on classes should come after you've learnt the raid bosses as if you
have no clue what your skills do AND have no idea what the boss does,
you'll die within 30 seconds and won't learn anything.

Whatever you bring - make sure it's geared appropriately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Subgroups

Usually you will have 2 subgroups. At some encounters, some commanders
will make 3 - more than that and you're entering speed clearing
territory.

Boons and buffs prioritise the people in your subgroup and then
proximity (if it's not capped by people in your subgroup being within
range). So it's important to put the right people in the right
subgroups.

Rules of subgroups:

- Split up the healers.
- Split up the quickness sources.
- Split up the alacrity sources.
- If you have thieves using venom, split them up if possible.
- If you have an alacrigade and a druid, put them in separate subgroups
to cover more protection uptime. Similarly a quick herald will do lots
of boons so give them to the healer with least boons.
- Put the tank in the subgroup of the healer who is going to be with
them the most, if relevant. If the healer is the tank, skip this step.
- Roles like handkite can be moved to their own subgroup if needed to
help with priority on boons for the rest of the squad.

So your subgroups will look something like (example power
composition):

1. alacrity druid, quick spellbreaker, reaper, weaver, virtuoso.
2. heal scrapper, alacrigade, dragonhunter, holosmith, daredevil.
