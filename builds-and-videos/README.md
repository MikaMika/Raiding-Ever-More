If you're looking for 1 finger game play, look no further than condi
virtuoso. 1 shatter every 5s. This is my version of condi virtuoso (I
can hit 32.5k if I actually press all the buttons or 25k with just those
2 - I have 2 condi damage infusions and 5 power on here as those are the
infusions I own but it doesn't make much difference).

Condi virtuoso tower gameplay. You can do escort towers solo but duo
with a heal firebrand or heal spectre or heal scrapper is a lot easier
and safer as they can keep you healthy and can bring extra pushes for if
yours don't quite work. You can also have stability on shatter and
expertise cap (if you have regen) with the chaos traitline and you take
the damage reduction trait instead of lesser chaos storm to have up to a
25% damage reduction. This along with some toughness on your armour
(sinister pieces changed to rabid and you can take some trailblazer if
needed).
