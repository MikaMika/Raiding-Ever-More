So you want to gear a character for raids?

There are a couple of usual rules and a few places you can look to find
where you can get gear.

Firstly - do not feel like you have to turn up with exactly the gear
that they had on the build page you saw when you're starting out - talk
to your training commander but don't feel like the entry requirement to
raids is super high.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ascended or Exotic?

There is zero requirement to be ascended geared in raids when you start
out. Exotic gear is fine as you don't need to have infusions. You will
eventually probably change into ascended as you go and get drops, but
the difference in stats isn't huge.

Saying that, you will still want to make sure that you crit cap, which
can mean an extra assassin piece instead of full berserker if you're in
exotics or slightly different food. Still, the difference in losing a
couple of % crit cap isn't going to be make or break in most runs
(unless you're all super low dps, in which case not crit capping is not
your issue).

If you ever want to go do quick clears or speedrunning, you will need to
be full ascended and infused - otherwise, realistically it's not gonna
make much difference to most people.

## How do I find gear for my characters?

One of the best resources and a link I give to everyone for gearing is
Tanetris' guide on wikipedia:

<https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character>

It breaks down the most common sets and gives a few cheaper
alternatives.

As a simplification, you can use the following for gear:

- Dungeons or karma merchants (berserker exotics mostly).
- Open world metas (e.g. bladed armour - stat selectable exotic gear)
and achievements (exotics and ascendeds).
- Guild commendations (ascendeds).
- Ascended trinkets from laurel vendors (berserker, diviner), living
world merchants (all) and living world achievements.
- Crafting (exotics or ascendeds).
- Fractals - drops and currency (ascendeds).
- Raid drops (ascendeds and exotics).
- Raid currency (ascendeds).
- sPvP currency (ascendeds).
- WvW currency (ascendeds).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What stats do I need?

Whilst this is dependent on the build you're running, since some will
need higher crit chance than others, the usual sets are:

- Berserker (sometimes with Assassin pieces) for power classes.
- Viper for condition classes.
- Ritualist for condition boon classes.
- Knights or Minstrel or Commander for tanking (can be mixed with
Berserker).
- Harrier for heal classes that do boons, mixed with Giver if tanking as
well.
- Magi for heal classes that don't do boons (e.g. pure heal tempest or
heal scourge) - can also be mixed with Harrier for heal/boon classes.
- Diviner for power boon classes.

The others that you may see:

- Trailblazer for condition based tanks or where toughness tanking isn't
an issue.
- Plaguedoctor for hybrid heal/condition scourges.
- Celestial for hybrid heal/condition classes like renegade, tempest and
firebrand.
- Dragon for some power based builds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## So what are these rules you mentioned earlier?

1. If you are dps, do NOT have toughness on your gear. Soulbeasts and
catalysts are the exceptions to having 1,000 toughness as a dps class,
as power soulbeasts have an innate 1,150 and dps catalysts have 1.2k
toughness (support catas are usually about 1.1k). If you have over 1.2k,
you may end up tanking.
2. If you can't afford scholar runes, that's fine - get eagle or thief
or strength when you first start out and change when you can afford
it.
3. Always let your commander (and tank) know if you have toughness of
any kind on your gear or have innate toughness. Some bosses can be
tanked at 1,005 toughness so if you don't mention it, you might end up
tanking.
4. Sigil of Impact doesn't fully work in raids (as you can't stun or
knock down many of the bosses), so feel free to change that to any
"Slaying" sigil that's cheaper. Note if you are using the weapon outside
of raids, you'll probably want the Impact sigil.
5. All raid bosses are plants and it's never night in raids so Slaying
sigils and Night sigils don't do anything other than their static
bonuses.
6. Always take food and utility to a raid. Most food is fairly cheap -
if you can't afford the meta ones, see [food-and-utility] for
ones which are fairly close. Some commanders will drop food (but not
utility) but expect they won't and it'll be a nice surprise when they
do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ascended gear order

When you get to the point you are upgrading yourself from exotic to
ascended, try and do it in the following order. If you get gear as drops
not in this order, that's fine, but if you're buying it or crafting go
for the below.

1. Ascended trinkets (Rings then Earrings then Amulet)
2. Weapons (main set first if you have one)
3. Chest/Leggings (these are the highest stat armour pieces)
4. Shoulders
5. Backpiece
6. The rest of your armour (Headpiece, Gloves, Boots).

The idea behind this is most stats first and then later you upgrade
pieces with smaller stat bonuses.

If you're adding infusions, you can upgrade trinkets to hold more of
them, but the order doesn't matter as the amount of stats you get stays
the same. Note if you're not doing fractals so don't need the AR, you
can use WvW stat infusions which are cheaper.
